# Grade-Calculator
Android Application to calculate your final Grade

This app allows you to calculate your final grade wherever you are and whatever your college is, you can create custom profiles for your class where you set how much % of each grade is,
This was made as a personal app at first then i wanted to share it so i improved it and added the possibility of improting and creating configs that you can share with your class or even college to make calculating your final grade easier.

How to create a custom Config for people to import?
Create a txt file containing the following
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Line 1: Configuration name ("My Custom Configuration").
Following lines:
[Subject Name], [Coefficient], [CC Weight], [TP Weight], [Exam Weight]

If there is no CC or TP, place 0 in CC Weight and/or TP Weight.

Example
------------------------------------------------------------------------
```
Example:
Class Example
Math,3,30,20,50
Physics,2,20,30,50
Chemistry,2,25,25,50
```

To import it simply click on otherclasses, import config and press the txt file and save configuration, if you don't want to bother with this just create your config on the application directly which is done at the other classes tab.
